          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Description of Program and Card. </strong>
          Your Account allows you to deposit funds to or from the Account; make
          purchases for goods and services everywhere Mastercard®
          is accepted; perform ATM withdrawals at ATM devices
          that accept the card networks for the Account; and access your loaded funds or load your gaming-related
          winnings to
          the Account through participating gaming locations and/or gaming websites. The ability to use your funds in a
          gaming location is a highly unique feature of the Account and as such, is usable only in certain designated
          gaming
          locations that participate in the Program. Those locations accepting the Account for gaming purposes are part
          of a
          proprietary closed loop network not accessible to all persons. You must use your Account at a designated
          Program-accepting gaming location for the Account to work in a gaming context. The gaming features of the
          Account
          allow you to segregate and budget your entertainment spend separately from other accounts. You are able to
          manage your Account through a full-service mobile application (no additional charge for use). Koin’s
          Interactive
          Voice Response (IVR) system allows you to perform many important functions at no additional charge, and,
          during
          available hours, you may elect to speak to a live agent, however, additional fees may apply. Koin reserves the
          right to
          record and monitor all live calls for security and training purposes. We reserve the right to modify or cancel
          the
          Program at any time with notice to you. If we suspect your Account is being used in a fraudulent manner we may
          suspend, block or close your Account or reduce access to your Account.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Card is a prepaid card usable wherever prepaid debit cards bearing the applicable payment card network
          brand
          (e.g. Mastercard) (“Card Network”) on your Card are accepted worldwide. The Card is not a device that accesses
          money in an individual checking or savings account. When you use your Card, you are redeeming the value on the
          Card and not making a withdrawal from a checking or savings account. You may use your Card to make purchases
          at
          any merchant that accepts the Card Network’s cards, subject to your available Account balance and the other
          terms
          and conditions of this Agreement. You may not use your Card for any illegal online gambling, escort services,
          or any
          illegal transaction. The Card will have a printed expiration date and the Card will expire, in accordance with
          applicable

          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Important Information about Opening a New Card Account. </strong>
          To help the government fight the funding of
          terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
          record
          information that positively identifies each person who opens an Account. What this means for you: When you
          open
          an Account and before we issue a Card, we will ask for proof of or otherwise request your name, address, date
          of
          birth, Social Security Number, phone number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may
          also
          request additional identifying information and documentation from time to time in connection with your access
          to or
          use of certain Card features, functionality, and services.
        </p>

        <p>After your Account is opened, we may ask again to see a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying
          documents
          at any time if we deem it is necessary to verify your identity, address, or transactions on your Account. If
          we ask for
          specific identifying documents, we will have the right to immediately close or suspend your Account if those
          specific
          documents are not provided. These measures are specifically designed to help us protect your identity and
          identify
          possible fraud on your Account.</p>

          reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal. Please note that your withdrawal of consent to receive
          Communications electronically will not apply to Communications electronically provided by us to you before the
          withdrawal of your consent becomes effective.</p>

        <p>Hardware and Software Requirements. In order to access and retain Communications provided to you
          electronically,
          you must have: (1) a valid email address and/or a valid mobile phone number; (2) a computer or other mobile

        </p>

        <p>Copies of Communications. You should print and save and/or electronically store a copy of all Communications
          that

          to
          receive. For the avoidance of doubt, requesting a paper copy of any Communication, in and of itself, will not

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Funds Availability.</strong>
          Note that the availability of funds loaded to your Account depend on the source of the
          funds and the type of loaded value. Funds deposited in your Account, or funds transferred from other accounts
          from any other external bank account(s) are subject to normal Bank rules on funds availability. Funds loaded
          on
          to an Account through transfer from credit or debit cards, participating reload networks, and wagering account
          merchant locations for credit to your Account are available immediately.

          <strong>Funds loaded to an Account through bank to card transfers are not available immediately and are
            subject to a hold period as defined by Sutton Bank.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Use of Your Card and Account</strong>
          Your Card may be used to access the funds stored in your Account. You
          may use your Card to perform the following types of transactions (subject to the transaction limits):
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>At an ATM displaying the Accel or Maestro® logos, you may use your card to make withdrawals of
            cash up to the amount of funds in your Account not exceeding the daily cash withdrawal limit or to obtain
            Account balance information. Some of these services may not be available at all ATMs or at ATMs outside
            the United States; and</li>
          <li>At participating merchant locations displaying the Mastercard, Accel or Maestro® logos, you may
            use your card to purchase goods and services (and to obtain a limited amount of cash) up to the amount of
            funds in your Account.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <div style="margin-left: -14px;">
        <p>
          If you wish to use your card for a purchase which is greater than the balance of the funds available on your
          Account,
          you must advise the merchant to charge only the current loaded balance of prepaid funds available on the
          Account or
          less and then you must arrange to pay for the difference, if any, using another payment method. The merchant
          may
          require payment for the difference in cash rather than accepting another card, such as a credit or debit card.
          Some
          merchants may elect to not accept these “split transactions.” If you fail to inform the merchant prior to
          completing the transaction, your transaction may be declined due to insufficient funds available.
          <strong>Please note
            special rules for gas
            station purchases:</strong> You may use your card to make a purchase at a gas station or gas
          station/mini-market by
          going
          inside the location and making payment directly to the attendant. Your card will not be accepted for payment
          at the
          gas pump.
        </p>
        <p>If you use your card at a restaurant, a hotel, a car rental location, or for similar purchases, the
          anticipated purchase
          amount may include an additional sum up to 20% which is often added to ensure there are sufficient funds
          available
          to cover additional charges, gratuities or incidental damage incurred. Any preauthorization amount will place
          a “hold”
          on your available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your actual purchase. Once the
          final
          payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to fifteen
          (15) days
          (thirty days for hotels and sixty days for car rentals) for the hold to be removed. During the hold period,
          you will not
          have access to the preauthorized amount.</p>
        <p>If you use your card number without physical presentment of your card (such as for a mail order, telephone,
          or
          Internet purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the card itself. For security reasons,
          we may limit
          the amount or number of these transactions you can make on your Account or through the Card. You may not use
          your card or Account for any illegal transaction. You may use your Account for legal online gambling
          transactions,
          race and sports betting transactions, and other forms of legal gambling activities but only in locations and
          online
          gaming sites where we have authorized such use and the location is participating with our Program. You are
          solely
          responsible for determining whether the gaming you are participating in is legal. We have no liability for
          your
          participation in illegal gaming. All gaming related transactions are conducted through a private closed-loop
          network and are not transmitted through the Network.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the value available to you in your Card Account is limited to the balance of
          your
          Card Account. Each time you use your card, you authorize us to immediately reduce the value available on
          your
          Account by the amount of the transaction or preauthorization. You are not allowed to exceed the available
          amount on
          your Account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction
          exceeds the
          balance of the funds available on your Account (creating a \'negative balance\'), including any purchase
          transactions
          where the retailer or merchant does not request authorization, you shall remain fully liable to the Bank for
          the amount
          of the transaction and any applicable fees or charges. You agree to pay us promptly for the negative
          balance. If you
          do not promptly add sufficient funds to your Card Account to cover the negative balance, we may cancel your
          Card
          Account and pursue collection. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you are responsible for the
          reasonable costs
          we incur in collecting amounts owed by you to us under this Agreement, including reasonably attorneys’ fees
          and
          costs. We also reserve the right to cancel your Account should you create one or more negative balances with
          your
          Account. We further reserve the right to offset any negative balance by any current or future funds you may
          load to or
          maintain in your Card Account or funds in any other Card Account you maintain with us now or in the future.
        </p>
        <p>You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase or payment transaction originated by use of your
          Account.
          You may not make repetitive, preauthorized regular payments from your Account. This means that you cannot
          schedule in advance for recurring transfers to be made from your Card or Account. If you authorize a
          transaction and
          then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of
          funds as
          stated above.</p>
        <p>Where applicable, you may deposit or withdraw funds to and from your Account from legal gaming merchants or
          legal
          online and mobile gaming merchants that enable the use of the Program by selecting the appropriate user
          option(s)
          made available by the merchant or instructing a merchant representative to facilitate the deposit
          transaction.</p>
        <p>You agree to comply with the authentication methods used by the merchant gaming system, self-serve devices
          and/or
          location, such as a password, loyalty system PIN, card PIN or other methods that may be available to
          validate that
          you are the rightful account holder to conduct such deposit, withdrawal and purchasing transactions. You
          agree that
          by utilizing available authentication methods you are solely responsible for such withdrawal, deposit, and
          purchase
          activity. You agree that we may obtain and use your loyalty or wagering account information separately
          provided to or
          by a gaming location to facilitate deposit, withdrawal, and purchase transactions on your Account.s</p>

          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Your Personal Identification Number/Signature on the Account.</strong> To
          protect the use of your card for
          certain transactions, including automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, a personal identification number
          (“PIN”) will be required to conduct a transaction with your card. A PIN will be created for your card during
          the
          activation process. You may change this PIN at any time by calling Customer Service and selecting “Change
          PIN” from the menu option or by selecting the “Change PIN” option online at the Website. You should not
          disclose your PIN to anyone. If the security or confidentiality of your PIN is compromised, you should notify
          Koin
          at once. A PIN may not be necessary to purchase goods or services at merchant locations that accept
          Mastercard; however, you should remember your PIN in case it is requested.

          Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, your Account expires on the expiration date
          shown on your Card. If funds remain on your Account at expiration, and you have not activated a reissued card
          Account, you may request a replacement card at no charge, or request a balance refund check by calling the
          phone number listed on your Card. If we send you a balance refund check, it will be for the amount of funds
          remaining on your Card at expiration less any applicable fees, costs and expenses. Expiration or closure of

          <strong style="padding-left: 30px;">Foreign Currency Transactions. </strong>
          If you obtain your funds or make a purchase in a currency other than the
          currency in which your Card was issued, the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by the Card
          Network into an amount in the currency of your Card. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and
          the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by the Card Network
          from the
          range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may
          vary from the rate the Card Network itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the
          applicable
          central processing date. If you obtain your funds or make a purchase in a currency other than the currency in
          which your Card was issued, the Bank may assess a foreign currency conversion fee of 3% of the transaction
          amount and will retain this amount as compensation for its services. Transactions made outside of the 50
          United
          States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories are also subject to this conversion
          fee
          even if they are completed in U.S. currency.
        </p>
        <p>If you conduct a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the merchant, the Card Network or other
          entity that
          processes the transaction may convert any related debit or credit into U.S. dollars in accordance with its
          then-current
          policies. Mastercard currently uses a conversion rate that is either: (a) selected from a range of rates
          available in the
          wholesale currency markets (note: this rate may be different form the rate the association itself receives),
          or (b) the
          government-mandated rate. The conversion rate may be different from the rate in effect on the date of your
          transaction and date it is posted to your Account. In addition to the currency conversion charge, we will
          impose a
          charge equal to 3% of the transaction amount (including credits and reversals) as set forth in the chart above
          for each
          transaction (U.S. or foreign currency) that you conduct at merchants (including foreign websites) outside the
          United
          States.</p>

          All fee amounts will be withdrawn from your Account and will be
          assessed as long as there is a remaining balance in your Account, except where prohibited by law. Anytime your
          remaining Account balance is less than the fee amount being assessed, the balance of your Account will be
          applied to the fee amount resulting in a zero balance in your Account. We reserve the right to automatically
          deduct additional fees from your Account once reloaded if your Account results in a zero balance.
        </p>

        <p>If you use an ATM not owned by us for any transaction, including a balance inquiry, you may be charged a
          fee by the
          ATM operator even if you do not complete a withdrawal. This ATM fee is a third-party fee amount assessed by
          the
          individual ATM operator only and is not assessed by us. This ATM fee amount will be charged to your Card.
          Any fees
          charged by third parties will be your responsibility and will be charged to your Account. Funds deposited
          through the

          transferred
          from your Account without your permission. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses

        <p>Also, if your online or written transaction history statement shows transfers that you did not make,
          including those
          made by Card, PIN, code, or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the
          earliest of (i)
          you electronically access your Account, if the transfers could be viewed in your electronic history, or
          (ii) the date we
          sent the FIRST written history of your Account transactions on which the transfers appeared, you may not
          get back
          any value in your Account you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone
          from taking
          the value in your Account if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital
          stay) kept you
          from telling us, we may extend the time periods.</p>
