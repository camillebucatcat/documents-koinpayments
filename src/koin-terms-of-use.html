      current in your Koin account profile.</p>

        <p>If your Koin account is subject to a hold or limitation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Link or Unlink a Funding Method</h3>
    <p>You can link or unlink certain funding methods such as a credit card, debit card, or a U.S. bank
      account (via ACH) to fund your Koin account. The funding methods also include alternative wallet
      products (eg: ApplePay®, GooglePay®, PayPal®, etc.) and cash in via a cage cashier of a
      participating casino or at a participating retail merchant.</p>
    <p>Before linking a bank account, you should review and understand the consumer protection rights
      and remedies available for different funding sources under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
      (EFTA) and Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).</p>
    <p>Please keep your funding method information current (e.g., bank account and routing numbers, or
      debit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, we may update it using
      information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part. If you do not
      want us to update your funding method information, you may remove it from your Koin account.
      If we update your funding method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such funding
      method.</p>
    <p>We may need to verify that a funding method is valid and belongs to you. We may, but are not
      obligated to, process a micro-transaction to either your credit or debit card, and promptly refund
      the amount once it is confirmed. If your funding method is a bank account that you manually link
      to your Koin account by adding your bank account and routing we may verify by using (i) a real-
      time account verification service, if available, or (ii) we will make one or two small deposits to
      your provided bank account of less than $1.00 U.S. dollar each that you will need to confirm with
      us, along with a corresponding single debit from your bank account totaling the amount of the two
      small deposits.</p>

    <h3>General Authorization to Charge your Koin Account</h3>
    <p>By presenting your Koin account information to a merchant, you are authorizing Koin to make the
      payment or transfer of funds thru either the Koin system or via the Koin Prepaid Mastercard®
      associated with your Koin account.</p>
    <p>Each time you use Koin to purchase something from a merchant, you authorize Koin to charge
      your Koin account or the Koin Prepaid Mastercard® for the amount specified during the checkout
      process and any applicable fees. If the amount of your transaction changes after checkout, you
      authorize Koin to charge for the revised amount (eg: you add a tip, or add another service), or
      decrease the amount charged if the amount of the payment decreases.</p>
    <p>You also authorize Koin to charge your Koin account in connection with any errors, claims, or
      disputes, and for amounts you owe to Koin.</p>
    <p>If you have set up automatic payments with a merchant, you authorize Koin to charge your Koin
      account or the Koin Prepaid Mastercard® each time you make a purchase from that merchant,
      including via recurring payments or any other future transaction(s) scheduled in advance.</p>

    <h3>Revoking your authorization</h3>
    <p>You can revoke our authority to charge your Koin account. Such revocation only applies to
      transactions that are initiated, by you or by a merchant. Unlinking a funding method also revokes
      our authority to transfer balances in your Koin account to a previously linked bank account or debit
      card. If there is a pending transaction with a merchant where you have authorized the transaction,
      but the merchant has not yet completed the transaction, you may not be able to unlink the funding
      method used until the transaction is completed.</p>

    <h3>Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance, or Transferring Funds</h3>
    <p>Money sent to your Koin account will be held as a balance in your Koin account. When you receive
      money to your Koin account, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Make purchases with merchants that accept Koin as a tender type, or thru the use of the
          Koin Prepaid Mastercard® . This can be either online, at a merchant's website or thru a
          merchant's mobile application by selecting with pay with Koin button or using the Koin
          Prepaid Mastercard® number. You can also make a purchase at a merchant's store using
          your mobile device and a QR code, or using the Koin Prepaid Mastercard®
          .</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your linked bank account;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>request Koin to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee). If
          you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of
          issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked bank account.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Transfer funds to a gaming device or cashless wagering account and then to a gaming
          device or gaming activity, subject to state regulation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Conduct an ATM cash withdraw (subject to applicable ATM and third-party fees)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you purchase something from a merchant using your Koin account and the transaction is
      ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to Koin account.</p>
    <p>Funds transferred to you Koin account are placed in one or more banks insured by the Federal
      Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that we choose in our discretion, and that provide FDIC
      insurance on your Koin account.</p>
    <p>Koin is not a bank, does not take deposits and is not FDIC insured.</p>

      activity. You may view your Koin account statement by logging into the Koin App. You should

      with your Koin account.</p>

              court and are between us (or any Related Party) and you. In this Arbitration
              Agreement, the word "Disputes" has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes all
              claims even indirectly related to your Advance Account, Wagering Account, the
              Services, this Agreement or the relationships between you and us and/or "Related
              Parties" (including without limitation your application, past agreements, information
              you previously gave us, extensions, renewals, payment plans, collections, privacy
              and customer information). "Disputes" includes, but is not limited to, initial claims,
              counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims, and claims based on any
              constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law rule (including rules relating
              to contracts, torts, negligence, fraud or other intentional wrongs) and equity. It
              includes claims that seek relief of any type, including damages and/or injunctive,
              declaratory or other equitable relief. It includes claims related to the validity in general
              of this Agreement. However, it does not include disputes about the validity, coverage
              or scope of this Arbitration Agreement or any part of this Arbitration Agreement. (This
              includes a Dispute about the rules against class arbitration and against an Arbitrator
              issuing relief to anyone except you, us and Related Parties.) All such disputes are for
              a court and not an Arbitrator to decide. But a Dispute about this Agreement as a
              whole is for an Arbitrator, not a court, to decide.</p>

              administrator that would permit a class arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
              The Arbitrator will be selected under the administrator's rules. However, the Arbitrator
              must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you

              claim money damages. This includes pre-judgment seizure, injunctions, or equitable
              relief. Even if all parties have opted to litigate a Dispute in court, you or we may elect

              If you are the complaining party, you must send the notice in writing (and not

              attorney) can be reached. A letter from us to you will serve as our written notice of a
              Dispute. Once a Dispute notice is sent, the complaining party must give the other
              party a reasonable opportunity over the next 30 days to resolve the Dispute on an
              individual basis.

              from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such
              claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted),
              the claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual
              claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties will
              request that the court stay the claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration
              award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court. In no event will a claim
              for public injunctive relief be arbitrated.</p>
